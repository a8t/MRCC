Thank you to all who attended our last workshop of the IMPACT series! Last Saturday's topic was digital fundraising. We participated in activities that helped exercise our digital fundraising skills such as creating profiles of our demographic and target audience.

One key lesson learned was that the centre of the work we do is always people. This includes digital fundraising - as a fundraiser, it is important to know who you are asking donations from and to know why they would donate. What are their motivations and inspirations for supporting your cause? Find out so that you can tell a story that resonates. 

We hope that everyone learned something, and can't wait to see all the wonderful work you will do!
