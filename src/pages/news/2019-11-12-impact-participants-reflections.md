I am very glad that I got to attend MRCC workshop on migrants' well-being and access to healthcare. I think considering how many people in Toronto actually don't have a status or have a precarious status, it's the topic that everyone should be interested in. Canada prides itself to have universal healthcare. But to whom this healthcare is actually available?

I am a student of Assaulted Women and Children Counselor/Advocate program and in my future career I'd like to work with migrant communities. Hence I think it was so important to meet advocates and activists who had so much practical advice on how to care for those communities, despite different barriers and limitations. This workshop provided me with an opportunity to listen to people who had so much experience dealing with discrimination and oppression first hand. It was very empowering to hear about successes of campaigners and changes that they achieved in giving folks access to healthcare. There's obviously so much that still needs to be done, but I think it's important to celebrate all victories, even small ones, and build on them.

I'm an international student myself and on a personal level it was great to just connect with other migrants and allies, exchange experiences and thoughts and to just enjoy each other's company (and delicious food!). I am definitely looking forward to other workshops hosted by MRCC because I think they will give me practical skills and confidence to tackle oppressive systems and be successful in advocating for migrants in Canada.

The workshop opened my eyes about the marginalization of undocumented migrants in accessing health services in Canada. While the country celebrates fairness and equality among its citizens, many are discriminated in getting medical assistance due to their precarious immigration status. The FCJ Refugee Centre does an amazing work in providing support to these people, and now the conversation needs to move forward on how to share this knowledge to others and empower them in accessing not only health services, but a wide range of social services to promote their well-being.
