The role of community leaders is to communicate their ideas to a broader audience. Crafting an effective piece of writing could assist greatly in this process but for those who do not have an academic background or prior experience in writing, this can be a daunting task.  In order to assist with this task, MRCC hosted a Writing for empowerment workshop as part of our IMPACT workshop series.  We taught the participants how to write statements, articles, and/or journals for the purpose of collective transformations and empowerment.
