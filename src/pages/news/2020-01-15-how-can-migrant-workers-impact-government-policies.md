The Canadian political system can be confusing for those who recently arrived in the country. Yet knowing where to direct your grievance is crucial for running a successful advocacy campaign. The purpose of this workshop was to educate migrants and newcomers about how the Canadian political system works through different levels of government so they can better mobilize and advocate for themselves.
