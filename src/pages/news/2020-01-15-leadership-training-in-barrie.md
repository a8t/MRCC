Barrie got a sneak peek at our Leadership and Training workshop which will take place in Toronto on March 7th.

Migrants in the City of Barrie attended in this fun and interactive workshop in order to educate and influence individuals regarding changes in the permanent residency application process.



The workshop on March 7th will be aimed at developing the leadership capacity of the participants to be able to advocate around issues that affect them and their community. More information will be sent out closer to the date.
