Happy holidays!

December was festive and fun as we celebrated the holidays by playing games in addition to learning and empowering participants through our Advocacy and Campaign workshop.

This workshop focused on teaching and empowering migrant workers on how to be community leaders, as well as how to build their networks and effectively communicate their demands towards a better recognition of their rights and welfare.
