**WRITING FOR EMPOWERMENT**

**Saturday, November 23, 2019**

**2482 Dufferin Street Toronto, ON M6B 3R1** 

The role of community leaders is to communicate their ideas to a broad audience. Crafting an effective piece of writing could assist greatly in this process, but for those who don't have academic background or prior experience in writing, this can be a daunting task. Moreover, writing is often thought of as a solitary endeavor rather than a collective process. This workshop will teach the participants how to write statements, articles, or journals for the purposes of collective transformation and empowerment.
