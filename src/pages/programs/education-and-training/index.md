MRCC community work is about the empowerment of individuals and im/migrant communities to address the unequal relations of power, linking individuals and their lived experiences with an analysis of power and structural inequality and encouraging a move from individual response to a collective one.

In MRCC, this happens through a series of Know Your Rights workshops and issue based educational series.
