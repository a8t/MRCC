The first workshop of the IMPACT series featured speakers Sol Pajadura, Chairperson of Migrante Canada, and
Alex Banaag, National Representative of United Food and Commercial Workers.

It focused on relevant federal immigration policies and provincial labour laws that affect workers lives daily. Participants had the opportunity to gain a basic understanding of relevant laws and learn the rights of residents in Canada.
